There is a pool overflow in cldflt.sys mini filter driver. Information on this can be read here [1] and here [2].

The reason is that the driver is not sufficiently checks a data that comes from NTFS reparse point.

The function HsmFltProcessHSMControl is responsible for processing cloud filter FSCTLs. For an operation with code 0xC0000003 , it will eventually call HsmFltProcessUpdatePlaceholder . After some processing the execution flow will reach HsmiOpUpdatePlaceholderDirectory and then finally HsmpRp
